# EVBox
My solution to the EVBox backend coding assignment

The boilerplate for this project was generated using start.spring.io. 
The assignment is in `assignment.pdf`

To run the server, execute `gradle bootRun`. All the endpoints function
as documented in `assignment.pdf`.

The base implementation in the `master` branch is finished as of
commit `2c7a10b4`. Note that this implementation is not yet 
thread-safe. The work for a threadsafe implementation has been 
started in the `threadsafe` branch.
